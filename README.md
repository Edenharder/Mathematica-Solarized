# Mathematica Solarized

A [Solarized Dark][solarized] theme for Mathematica.  I have not created a
Solarized Light theme, but it should be quite straightforward to implement (and
if you do, please consider submitting a pull request â˜º).

The stylesheet file is `SolarizedDarkStylesheet.nb` and is generated from
`SolarizedDark.nb`.  If you wish to change anything, you can do so in
`SolarizedDark.nb` and recreate `SolarizedDarkStylesheet.nb`.  In particular,
you may consider changing the fonts.

The theme mostly works, though there are a few components which don't fit in
with the theme (mostly, dynamic/interactive content, and objects with special
formatting such as `SparseArray` and `Entity`).

I am no longer using it much as I have opted for another theme that resembles
more closely the default theme.  You are welcome to use it, and please feel free
to submit pull requests if you wish to change things.
